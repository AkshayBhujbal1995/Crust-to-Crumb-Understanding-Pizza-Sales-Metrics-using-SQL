Welcome to the Pizza Sales Analytics project! This repository contains an in-depth analysis of pizza sales data using SQL queries. From basic inquiries to advanced analytics, we dive into the dataset to uncover valuable insights for optimizing pizza sales strategies.

## Project Overview

- **Data Sets**: The project utilizes four datasets - orders, order_details, pizza_types, and pizzas - sourced from Kaggle.
- **Analytics**: We tackled a spectrum of questions, from basic inquiries to advanced analytics, using SQL queries.
- **Analysis Highlights**: Explore key insights such as total orders placed, revenue generated, popular pizza types, distribution of orders by hour, and more.
